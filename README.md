Real World Map Scale for blender 
adds a new node group in shader editor in add node menu which outputs a single float value to be used as texture map scale in mapping node

by doing so every object that shares the material, textures will be shown the same size campare to each other. In some way I tried to do what 'real world map' option does in 3ds max
